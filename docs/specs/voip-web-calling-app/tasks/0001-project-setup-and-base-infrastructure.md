# Task 1: Project Setup and Base Infrastructure

## Overview

Set up the foundation infrastructure for the VoIP Web Calling App including Next.js 14 project initialization, Supabase integration, authentication system, and base UI components.

## Phase

Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Initialize Next.js 14 project with App Router and TypeScript configuration

- Set up project structure with `src/app` directory layout
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode and path aliases
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality
- **References Requirements**: R7.1 (3-second load time), R8.4 (HTTPS encryption)

### 1.2 Configure Supabase integration and database schema

- Set up Supabase project with PostgreSQL database
- Implement database schema from design document (profiles, contacts, phone_numbers, call_sessions, tasks, voip_credentials, import_batches tables)
- Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant data isolation
- Set up database indexes for contact search and call history performance
- **References Requirements**: R8.2 (data encryption), R8.3 (secure authentication)

### 1.3 Implement Supabase authentication system

- Set up Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
- Create authentication middleware for Next.js App Router
- Implement JWT token handling with automatic refresh
- Build login, logout, and user profile management components
- **References Requirements**: R8.3 (secure authentication), R8.6 (session timeout)

### 1.4 Create base UI components and design system

- Build reusable components (Button, Input, Modal, Layout, Navigation)
- Implement responsive layout with mobile-first approach
- Create loading states and error boundary components
- Set up component testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- **References Requirements**: R7.5 (responsive design), R7.6 (clear error messages)

## Dependencies

- None (foundation task)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all components with >80% coverage
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- Manual testing of responsive design
- Security validation for authentication

## Deliverables

- Working Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Supabase database with complete schema
- Authentication system with login/logout
- Base UI component library
- Development environment setup

## Definition of Done

### ✅ COMPLETED (SaaS Starter Kit)
- [x] Next.js project runs without errors (✅ Next.js 15.1.7 with App Router)
- [x] Basic Supabase integration configured (✅ Auth, database types, client utilities)
- [x] Authentication flow works end-to-end (✅ NextAuth.js v5 with Google OAuth + email)
- [x] Basic UI components are responsive (✅ Tailwind CSS with responsive design)
- [x] TypeScript configuration with strict mode (✅ tsconfig.json configured)
- [x] ESLint and Prettier setup (✅ Code quality tools configured)

### 🔄 PARTIALLY COMPLETED (Needs VoIP Adaptation)
- [ ] **VoIP-specific database schema** - Currently has basic SaaS tables (users, notes, stripe_customers), needs VoIP tables:
  - [ ] contacts table with timezone and country_code fields
  - [ ] phone_numbers table with validation and call tracking
  - [ ] call_sessions table for call history and quality metrics
  - [ ] tasks table for contact-related task management
  - [ ] voip_credentials table for encrypted VoIP.ms credentials
  - [ ] import_batches table for CSV import tracking
- [ ] **Row Level Security policies** for VoIP-specific tables
- [ ] **Database indexes** for contact search and call history performance

### ❌ MISSING (Still Required for VoIP App)
- [ ] **Husky git hooks** for pre-commit validation
- [ ] **Error boundary components** for call interface error handling
- [ ] **Component testing setup** (Jest + React Testing Library)
- [ ] **VoIP-specific UI components**:
  - [ ] Contact list with phone number click-to-call
  - [ ] Dialpad interface component
  - [ ] Call status indicator components
  - [ ] Task management interface
- [ ] **Testing infrastructure** with >80% coverage requirement

### 📋 REVISED REMAINING TASKS
Since the SaaS foundation is complete, remaining work focuses on VoIP-specific features:

1. **Database Migration**: Create VoIP tables and RLS policies (estimated: 4-6 hours)
2. **Error Boundaries**: Add call-specific error handling (estimated: 2-3 hours) 
3. **Testing Setup**: Configure Jest + RTL + component tests (estimated: 6-8 hours)
4. **Git Hooks**: Add Husky for pre-commit validation (estimated: 1-2 hours)
5. **VoIP UI Foundation**: Basic contact list and dialpad components (estimated: 8-12 hours)

**Total Remaining Effort**: ~21-31 hours (reduced from original ~80 hours due to SaaS starter)
