# Task 11: Contact History and Timeline

## Overview

Implement comprehensive contact interaction history, call analytics, and activity filtering system.

## Phase

Phase 3: Advanced Features and Data Management (Weeks 8-10)

## Subtasks

### 11.1 Implement comprehensive contact interaction history

- Build chronological timeline of all contact interactions
- Create call history display with dates, duration, and notes
- Add task history and completion tracking
- Implement interaction frequency analysis
- **References Requirements**: R3.3 (call history), R3.5 (chronological log), R6.7 (interaction timeline)

### 11.2 Build call analytics and statistics

- Create call statistics dashboard (total calls, success rate, duration)
- Implement call frequency tracking and interval analysis
- Build contact activity scoring and prioritization
- Add timezone-based calling pattern analysis
- **References Requirements**: R6.5 (call statistics), R6.6 (call frequency)

### 11.3 Create contact activity filtering and reporting
