# Task 12: Performance Optimization

## Overview

Optimize application performance to meet the 3-second load time requirement and implement offline-first capabilities.

## Phase

Phase 4: UI/UX Optimization and Final Integration (Weeks 11-12)

## Subtasks

### 12.1 Implement performance optimizations for 3-second load time

- Optimize Next.js bundle size with code splitting
- Implement lazy loading for contact lists and components
- Add image optimization and CDN configuration
- Create performance monitoring and Core Web Vitals tracking
- **References Requirements**: R7.1 (3-second load time)

### 12.2 Optimize database queries and real-time performance

- Implement query optimization with proper indexing
- Add database connection pooling and caching strategies
- Optimize Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Create efficient pagination for large contact lists
- **References Requirements**: R7.4 (pagination), database performance

### 12.3 Build offline-first capabilities and sync optimization

- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- Create local storage caching for contact data
- Build conflict resolution for offline changes
- Add sync status indicators and manual sync triggers
- **References Requirements**: R7.6 (error handling), data availability

## Dependencies

- All previous tasks (foundation required for optimization)

## Testing Requirements

- Performance testing with load time measurements
- Offline functionality testing
- Large dataset performance testing
- Real-time performance testing

## Deliverables
