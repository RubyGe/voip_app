## Overview

Build the foundation for contact management including data models, API routes, contact list display, and CRUD operations.

## Phase

Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)

## Subtasks

- Add server-side validation for contact data fields
- **References Requirements**: R2.1 (CSV import), R2.2 (multiple phone numbers)

### 2.2 Build contact list display component

- Create ContactList component with infinite scroll pagination
- Implement real-time search across name, phone, email, and company fields
