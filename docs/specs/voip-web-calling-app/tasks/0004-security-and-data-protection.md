# Task 4: Security and Data Protection

## Overview

Implement comprehensive security measures including encryption for sensitive data, security headers, and data protection compliance.

## Phase

Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)

## Subtasks

### 4.1 Implement encryption for sensitive data

- Set up Supabase Vault for VoIP credential encryption
- Implement AES-256 encryption for stored passwords
- Create secure credential storage and retrieval functions
- Add encryption key rotation and management
- **References Requirements**: R8.1 (credential encryption), R8.2 (data encryption)

### 4.2 Configure security headers and HTTPS enforcement

- Set up security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Configure HTTPS-only cookies and secure session handling
- Implement CSRF protection for all API routes
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- **References Requirements**: R8.4 (HTTPS encryption), R8.6 (session security)

### 4.3 Implement data protection compliance

- Create data retention policies and cleanup procedures
- Implement user data export functionality for GDPR compliance
- Add consent management for data processing
- Create audit logging for sensitive operations
- **References Requirements**: R8.7 (data protection regulations)

## Dependencies

- Task 1: Project Setup and Base Infrastructure (Supabase setup required)

## Testing Requirements

- Security testing for encryption/decryption
- Penetration testing for authentication
- GDPR compliance validation
- Rate limiting testing

## Deliverables

- Encrypted credential storage system
- Security headers configuration
- GDPR compliance features
- Audit logging system
- Rate limiting implementation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] VoIP credentials are encrypted at rest
- [ ] All security headers are properly configured
- [ ] CSRF protection is active on all API routes
- [ ] Data export functionality works for GDPR
- [ ] Audit logs capture all sensitive operations
