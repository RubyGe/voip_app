# Requirements Document - VoIP Web Calling App with Contact Management

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based VoIP calling application with integrated contact management and task tracking capabilities. The application will streamline the user's current workflow by integrating VoIP calling functionality directly into a browser-based contact management system, eliminating the need to switch between multiple applications for sales and outreach activities.

The system will integrate with existing VoIP.ms credentials to provide seamless calling capabilities while offering comprehensive contact organization, task management, and call tracking features optimized for timezone-based batch calling workflows.

## Requirements

5. WHEN a call is in progress THEN the system SHALL display call duration and connection status
6. WHEN the user ends a call THEN the system SHALL properly terminate the VoIP connection
7. WHEN the user needs to update credentials THEN the system SHALL provide a settings option to modify or re-enter VoIP.ms authentication information
8. WHEN stored credentials become invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt for credential update and maintain secure re-authentication flow
9. IF the VoIP connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2: Contact Management System

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple prospects, I want to import and organize contact information with multiple phone numbers per contact, so that I can efficiently manage my outreach activities.

5. WHEN displaying contact groups THEN the system SHALL show current local time for each timezone
6. WHEN planning calls THEN the system SHALL highlight optimal calling windows (e.g., 9am-2pm local time)
7. WHEN sorting contacts THEN the system SHALL replicate the Pipedrive workflow of organizing by phone number patterns

### Requirement 5: Data Import and Export Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user transitioning from existing CRM systems, I want to import contact data from CSV files and export my updated contact information, so that I can maintain data continuity across systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria
